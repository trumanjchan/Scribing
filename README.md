# Scribing

Scribing is a website application similar to 10fastfingers where users can test their typing speed and compete with their friends.

[Shivanshu Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shiv248/) and [Truman Chan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trumanjfchan/) created this web app for their University of California, Merced Full Stack Computing final course project back in Fall 2021.

It was done with the power of NodeJS in React leveraging statefullness and hooks for the frontend, served on an Express + Socket.io backend, connected to a FreeDB mySQL network relational database, and hosted on Fly.io.

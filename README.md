# Scribing

Scribing is a website application similar to 10fastfingers and typeracer where users can test their typing speed and compete with their friends.

Shivanshu Gupta and Truman Chan created this web app for their UCM Full Stack Computing course.

It was done with the power of NodeJS in React leveraging statefullness and hooks for the frontend, served on an Express + Socket.io backend, connected to a FreeDB mySQL network relational database and hosted with ❤️ on Fly.io.

Originally deployed to Heroku under the free plan. Now deployed to Fly.io.
